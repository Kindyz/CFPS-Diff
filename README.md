# Welcome to CFPS-Diff!
**Contrast Flow Pattern and Cross-Phase Specificity-Aware Diffusion Model (CFPS-Diff)** is a generative diffusion model that can synthesize multiphase CECT  from NCCT.


This repository contains the code to our paper "Contrast Flow Pattern and Cross-Phase Specificity-Aware Diffusion Model for NCCT-to-Multiphase CECT Synthesis".


# Setup Environment
In order to run our model, we suggest you create a virtual environment
```
conda create -n CFPS-Diff_env python=3.8
```
and activate it with
```
conda activate CFPS-Diff_env
```
Subsequently, download and install the required libraries by running
```
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu118 torchvision==0.15.1+cu118 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Prepare Dataset
To simpify the dataloading for your own dataset, we provide a default dataset that simply requires the path to the folder with your NifTI images inside, i.e.
```
./Glioma_DATA/RAW_DATA/Train         ./Glioma_DATA/RAW_DATA/Test/                        # Path to the folder that contains the images
較럭較? ET-1 	# ET label               較럭較? PA_001                   # ID is not important and can be randomly generated to ensure anonymity
    較럭較? ID_001                               較럭較? T1.nii.gz        # The sequence of the NifTI (strictly consistent)
            較럭較? T1C.nii.gz                   較럭較? T2F.nii.gz       
            較럭較? T1.nii.gz            較럭較? PA_002            
            較럭較? T2F.nii.gz                   較럭較? T2F.nii.gz
            較럭較? ROI.nii.gz                   較럭較? T1.nii.gz     
        Generated by BET             較럭較? ...      
    較럭較? ID_002  
            較럭較? T1C.nii.gz        
            |較?較? ...           
    較럭較? ... 
較럭較? ET-0 
    較럭較? ID_100 
    較럭較? ID_101  	                   
```
If needed, you may consider downloading the glioma public dataset from [BraTS 2023 Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn51156910/wiki/).

Before training, the data needs to be preprocessed by **'Grayscale Normalization'** and mapped to the range of 0 to 255 by executing the following command
```
bash ./preprocess/Preprocess_grayscale_norm.sh
```


# Training
First, you need to train the condictional diffusion model. To do so in prepared dataset, you can run the following command:
```
python ./main/train_CFPS-Diff_gen.py
You can use the following command to observe the loss curve of the training process, visualize the sample image, etc.
```
tensorboard --lodgir ./main/trained_models/CFPS-Diff_gen/(model save filename)
```

# Inference
In the inference stage, synthesis and identification are performed together. You can do this by running the following command:
```
python ./main/Inference.py
```
